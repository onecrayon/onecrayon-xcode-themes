These .xccolortheme files are ports of my [Earthworm](http://onecrayon.com/products/earthworm/) and [Quiet Light](http://onecrayon.com/products/quiet-light/) themes for [Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/) to XCode.  Thanks to XCode's relatively inflexible syntax definition system compared to Espresso, the port isn't perfect, but the general feel for both themes is intact (at least for Objective-C files; I have not tested these themes with other languages).

To use one or both of the themes, copy the .xccolortheme files into this directory (creating it if necessary):

    ~/Library/Application Support/Xcode/Color Themes/

Both themes are released under an MIT license, so feel free to use them as you wish.  If you have feedback/kudos/critique please feel free to [contact me directly](http://onecrayon.com/about/contact/).

Enjoy!
